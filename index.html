            <h2>GameHub</h2>

            <p>During the last two rounds of working on the gamehub site, I never had time to style the “<a
                    href="https://game-hub-portfolio.netlify.app/account/account-profile.html">account
                    profile</a>” page. During the process of styling the account profile page, I added javascript to
                control
                the tab-navigation. I then applied that javascript to the tab-navigation on the <a
                    href="https://game-hub-portfolio.netlify.app/game/product.html?id=43">product pages</a>. I
                also made adjustments to the login, sign-up, confirmation, and contact pages. </p>

            <p>I was never quite happy with the header on this site, it was super wonky when it was resized, so I
                fixed that. Since the navigation is so simple I got rid of the drop-nav and kept it visible at every
                size and adjusted the search bar as well. I also updated the background image so it was less
                pixelated and the logo so the tagline is visible.</p>

            <p>On the product page I adjusted the layout and got rid of the price card. In the end it was just too
                busy, and I felt a simpler approach was best. </p>

            <h2>Community Science Museum</h2>

            <p>For the improvements to this site, I started by adding javascript where appropriate. This includes
                the
                opening hours on the top of the site. Now they will update dynamically and display the day’s hours.
                I
                also added javascript for navigation control, and subscribe and form validation.</p>

            <p>For non-javascript changes, referenced the feedback I received on the project to make the image
                banners
                stretch across the screen and also updated my colors to make them all accessible. </p>

            <h2>The Actic Berg</h2>
            <p>I based my improvements for this site on the feedback I received. I added font-family style to the
                paragraph tags and some of the heading tags (don’t understand how I managed to leave that off
                before), I added email validation and made adjustments to the form HTML to not include break tags. I
                also went through all my images and added alt-text where needed. </p>

            <p>I updated the javascript to style the category link for the page the user has clicked on. I also
                added javascript to dynamically update the page titles for individual blog posts. I also adjusted
                the javascript to display the primary category and not the “all posts” category on the carousel
                links and on the individual posts. I attempted to hide the carousel buttons, but didn’t quite figure
                it out in time. </p>
